# Tango Dico

Tango Dico lets Japanese language students quickly look up the words they need, their translation and more!

* Search by kanji, kana or English.
* See the type of each word (noun, verb, adjective and more).
* See the form of an adjective or verb.

Users of the Genki manuals can also filter the results by lessons, letting you quickly narrow the search to the words you have already reviewed.

The full application is available in both English and French.

⚠️ The Japan Times Publishing, who make the Genki manuals, do not endorse this application.
